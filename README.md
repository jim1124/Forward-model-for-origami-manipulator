# Forward-model-for-origami-manipulator
This matlab code is the forward model of the origami manipulator (developed based on our TMECH2022 paper).
In this version of code, developed in April 2024, the direction of the modules are considered.
The visualization is more detailed (see the modulesPlot.m function of the class Modules).
Basic collision detection between the components (links and plates) and the obstacle is implemented (see Ray2FaceCollision.m and Face2FaceCollision.m functions of the class Modules).
